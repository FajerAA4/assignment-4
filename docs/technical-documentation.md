## 1. Technologies Used

| Technology | Purpose |
|-------------|--------|
| HTML | Page structure |
| CSS | Styling and themes |
| JavaScript | logic |
| APIs | External data |
| GitHub | Version control |
| AI Tools | Assistance |

---

## 2. Architecture

The architecture follows a client-side application model:

- HTML renders structure  
- CSS controls layout, visuals, and animations  
- JavaScript handles logic and state  
- APIs provide live dynamic content  
- localStorage stores settings and session-related values  

---

## 3. Features

### Dark Mode
Theme switching is implemented using
class toggling and persistence using `localStorage`.

### Filtering
Projects are filtered dynamically using arrays and conditions.

### APIs
External APIs are fetched asynchronously using `fetch()` and `async/await`.

## 4. Responsiveness

Media queries ensure:

- Layout adaptation  
- Mobile usability  
- Touch-friendly interfaces  
- Flexible grid structure  

---

## 5. Performance

Optimizations include:

- Minimal dependencies  
- Lightweight CSS  
- Lazy-loaded images  
- No frameworks  
- Optimized layout rendering  

---
## 6. AI Integration

AI supported:

- Debugging  
- Code review  
- UI design ideas  
- Documentation support  

All outputs were reviewed, modified, and checked.

## 7. Security & Data Handling

- Storage limited to browser only  
- APIs access public data only  

---

## 8. Future Enhancements

- Backend integration  
- Database support  
- Authentication system  
- Accessibility improvements  
- Admin control panel
